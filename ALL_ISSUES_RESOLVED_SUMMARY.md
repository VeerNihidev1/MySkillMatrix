## 🔧 **Critical Fix: Self-Assessment Submission**

### **Problem**: 
Self-assessment submission was failing for all users due to function parameter mismatch.

### **Root Cause**: 
The `submitSelfAssessment` function in the hook expected an `id` parameter, but the dashboard was passing the full assessment object.

### **Solution**: 
- Updated `submitSelfAssessment` function to accept full assessment data
- Added logic to handle both new assessments and updates to existing ones
- Fixed status history tracking
- Ensured proper data persistence

### **Result**: 
✅ Self-assessments now save and submit correctly for all users

## 🔐 **User Management Access Control**

### **Problem**: 
User management was available to all managers, but should be admin-only.

### **Solution**: 
- **For Admins**: Full User Management Panel with create/edit/deactivate capabilities
- **For Managers**: Team Management Panel showing only their direct reports
- **Access Control**: Role-based component rendering

### **Features Added**:

#### **Admin User Management Panel**:
- View all users with search and filtering
- Create new users with role assignment
- Edit existing user details
- Deactivate users
- User statistics dashboard

#### **Manager Team Management Panel**:
- View only direct reports
- See team member assessment progress
- Track pending reviews and completion rates
- Team summary statistics

### **Result**: 
✅ Proper role-based access control implemented

## 👤 **Add User Functionality**

### **Problem**: 
Add User button was not working - no modal or functionality.

### **Solution**: 
Implemented complete user creation system:

#### **Create User Modal**:
- Full form validation
- Role selection (Employee, Manager, Admin)
- Department assignment
- Manager assignment for employees
- Password requirements
- Email validation

#### **Edit User Modal**:
- Update user information

## 📊 **Manager Self-Assessment Access**

### **Problem**: 
Managers couldn't access self-assessment functionality.

### **Solution**: 
- Added "My Self Assessments" button in Manager Dashboard Quick Actions
- Button redirects to main assessment dashboard
- Managers can now create and submit their own assessments
- Maintains role-based dashboard separation

### **Result**: 
✅ Managers can now do their own self-assessments

## 👥 **Complete Demo Accounts**

### **Problem**: 
Main page only showed 3 demo accounts, missing the additional 5 users.

### **Solution**: 
Updated LoginPage to display all 8 users:

| User | Email | Password | Role | Department |
|------|-------|----------|------|------------|
| John Doe | john.doe@company.com | password | Employee | Engineering |
| Sarah Manager | sarah.manager@company.com | password | Manager | Engineering |

| Carol Marketing | carol.marketing@company.com | password | Manager | Marketing |

### **Features**:
