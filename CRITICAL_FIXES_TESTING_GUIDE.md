### **Testing Steps**:
1. **Login**: `john.doe@company.com` / `password`
2. **Open Assessment**: Click any skill card (e.g., "JavaScript")
3. **Fill Form**: 
   - Select self-assessed level (e.g., "Advanced")
   - Add justification text
   - Add development goals
4. **Submit**: Click "Submit for Review"
5. **Verify**: 
   - ✅ Modal should close
   - ✅ Assessment should appear in "Pending Reviews" count
   - ✅ Check browser console for success logs
   - ✅ Refresh page - assessment should persist

## 🔧 **Critical Fix 2: Admin Dashboard**

### **Problem**: 
Admin users had no dashboard - they were getting employee dashboard instead.

### **Solution Implemented**:

- **Overview**: System statistics and quick actions

- **Analytics**: System-wide analytics dashboard
- **My Assessments**: Admin can do self-assessments too

### **Testing Steps**:
1. **Login**: `admin@company.com` / `admin123`
2. **Verify Dashboard**: Should see Admin Dashboard (not employee dashboard)
3. **Test Navigation**:
   - ✅ Click "User Management" - should open user management panel
   - ✅ Click "Data Management" - should open data management panel
   - ✅ Click "Analytics" - should open analytics dashboard
