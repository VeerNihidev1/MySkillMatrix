# 🚨 **CRITICAL REGRESSION FIXED - SUBMIT FOR REVIEW & AUTO-REFRESH**

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED**

### **🔍 Root Cause:**
**Broken Data Refresh Mechanism**: The `refreshKey` state was being incremented but not properly connected to the data loading logic, causing:
- ❌ Submit for review not showing updated status
- ❌ Save as draft not updating UI without manual refresh
- ❌ Manager reviews not refreshing data

### **🛠️ Fix Applied:**

#### **1. ✅ Enhanced useAssessment Hook:**
- **Added Refresh Trigger**: `const [refreshTrigger, setRefreshTrigger] = useState(0)`
- **Updated useEffect**: Re-runs data initialization when `refreshTrigger` changes
- **Added refreshData Function**: `const refreshData = () => setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1)`
- **Exported Function**: Made `refreshData` available to components

#### **2. ✅ Fixed AssessmentDashboard:**
- **Imported refreshData**: Added to useAssessment destructuring
- **Replaced setRefreshKey**: All calls now use `refreshData()`
- **Removed Unused State**: Cleaned up `refreshKey` state
- **Proper Data Flow**: Ensures immediate UI updates

#### **3. ✅ Fixed ManagerDashboard:**
- **Imported refreshData**: Added to useAssessment destructuring
- **Removed window.location.reload()**: No more page reloads needed
- **Updated Dependencies**: Fixed useMemo dependencies
- **Consistent Refresh**: All refresh actions use same mechanism

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Code Changes:**

#### **useAssessment Hook:**
```typescript
// Added refresh trigger
const [refreshTrigger, setRefreshTrigger] = useState(0);

// Updated useEffect to depend on refreshTrigger
useEffect(() => {
  const { selfAssessments, managerAssessments, assessmentCycles } = DataManager.initializeData();
  setAssessmentCycles(assessmentCycles);
  setSelfAssessments(selfAssessments);
  setManagerAssessments(managerAssessments);
}, [refreshTrigger]); // Re-run when refreshTrigger changes

// Added refresh function
const refreshData = () => {
  setRefreshTrigger(prev => prev + 1);
};
```

#### **AssessmentDashboard:**
```typescript
// Import refreshData
const { refreshData } = useAssessment();

// Use in handlers
const handleCreateAssessment = (assessmentData) => {
  createSelfAssessment(draftData);
  refreshData(); // Immediate refresh
};

const handleSubmitAssessment = (assessmentData) => {
  submitSelfAssessment(submissionData);
  refreshData(); // Immediate refresh
};
```

#### **ManagerDashboard:**
```typescript
// Import refreshData
const { refreshData } = useAssessment();

// Simplified refresh handler
const handleRefreshData = () => {
  refreshData(); // No more page reload
};

// Use in review handler
const handleReviewAssessment = (managerAssessment) => {
  createManagerAssessment(managerAssessment);
  refreshData(); // Immediate refresh
};
```
